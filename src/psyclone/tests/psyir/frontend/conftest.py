''' Common pytest fixtures for the frontend directory '''

# This is similar to the top-level pytest 'parse' fixture but that one has
# a deprecation notice. However it is appropriate to use it inside the Fortran
# frontend tests because the fparser dependency should be encapsulated inside
# this module and the fixture won't go away.
