and :ref:`Doxygen <doxygen>`.

Doxygen-generated Documentation
===============================

.. raw:: html

   <p>
   If you would prefer to see the Doxygen-generated pages then they are 
   <a  href="_static/html/index.html">here.</a> Since these are generated
   separately there are no links back to this Sphinx-generated content - you
   will need to use the back button on your browser.
