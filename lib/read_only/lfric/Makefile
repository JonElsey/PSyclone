# This Makefile picks up the compiler to use plus any flags from
# environment variables. e.g.:
# 
# export F90=mpif90
# export F90FLAGS="-O3"
# export AR=ar

#TODO: #813 keeps track of adding enough files from LFRic to PSyclone to be
#      able to compile this library without the need of external
#      files (or #745, which will try to create a stand-alone example).

# This directory points to an external, compiled version of the LFRic,
# which is required to find the module files when compiling this library:
LFRIC_DIR ?= ../../../../../lfric/work/trunk/miniapps/gravity_wave/working/field
