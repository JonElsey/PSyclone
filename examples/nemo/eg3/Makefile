# Makefile for the 3rd NEMO example. Uses PSyclone (which must
# be installed) to generate Fortran with OpenACC directives for
# the tracer-advection benchmark. The 'compile' target requires
# the dl_timer library (bitbucket.org/apeg/dl_timer) which must
# be installed and the location specified in DL_TIMER_ROOT below.
#
# The compiler to use must be specified via the F90 environment
# variable. e.g. to use PGI and OpenACC:
#
# export F90=pgf90
# export F90FLAGS="-O1 -acc -ta=tesla,cc70 -Minfo=all"
# export LDFLAGS="-acc -ta=tesla,cc70"
include ../../common.mk
