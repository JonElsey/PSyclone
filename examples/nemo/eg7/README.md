# PSyclone NEMO Example 7 - Kernel Data Extraction

**Author:** J. Henrichs, Bureau of Meteorology

This example demonstrates the use of PSyclone to add code for kernel
extraction, i.e. writing input- and output-data of a kernel into a data file.

Once you have installed PSyclone, either script may be supplied to
PSyclone via the -s option, e.g.:

```sh
psyclone -l all  -s ./extract_kernels.py ../code/tra_adv.F90
```

Or you can just execute ``make``, which will generate a file ``psy.f90``.

Executing this command will output the transformed Fortran code with the 
kernel extraction code added. Note that some of the lines in this
Fortran code would exceed the 132-character limit, which is remedied
by supplying the `-l all` flag to PSyclone (as is done in the Makefile).


## Compilation

This example can be compiled by using ``make compile``, and then executed.
The following environment variables can be set to define the compiler you
want to use:

```shell
export F90=gfortran
export F90FLAGS="-Wall -g -fcheck=bound"
```
They default to use ``gfortran`` with ``-g -O0``.

The three different extraction libraries, as described in
[PSyKE extraction libraries](https://psyclone.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psyke.html#extraction-libraries)
can be linked in.  The stand-alone extraction library in
``../../../lib/extract/standalone/nemo`` is used as default, and
will also be automatically compiled. You can set the ``TYPE`` environment
variable to either ``standalone_ascii``
or ``netcdf`` when compiling to use the other libraries::

    $ TYPE=netcdf make compile
    $ TYPE=standalone_ascii make compile

 To compile the example, the following dependencies are needed:
- one of the LFRic PSyData wrapper libraries, either:
    - ``lib_kernel_data_netcdf`` from
      ``<PSYCLONEHOME>/lib/extract/netcdf/lfric`` and NetCDF,
    - ``lib_kernel_data_standalone`` from
      ``<PSYCLONEHOME>/lib/extract/standalone/lfric``, or
    - ``lib_kernel_data_standalone_ascii`` from
      ``<PSYCLONEHOME>/lib/extract/standalone_ascii/lfric``

The infrastructure and PSyData wrapper libraries will be compiled
if they are not available, the NetCDF library requires NetCDF to
be available (including ``nf-config`` to detect installation-specific
paths).

The binary  instrumented for extraction will either be called
``traadv-standalone.exe``, ``traadv-standalone_ascii.exe`` or
``traadv-netcdf.exe``.

`tra_adv.F90` is a stand-alone version of one of the tracer-advection
routines from the NEMO ocean model. It was originally extracted by
Silvia Mocavero of CMCC. The code can be found in the `../code`
directory.

## Execution

This example can be compiled and executed, resulting in several
data files created. The size of domain and number of time-steps are also
picked-up from environment variables. Some example settings are provided
in the `domain_setup.sh` file. Using ``make run`` will run a small
test using:

```shell
export F90=gfortran
IT=2 JPI=10 JPJ=10 JPK=5  ./traadv-standalone.exe
```
which is a very fast run. This example will create 14 data files, e.g.
``tra_adv-r0.binary``, ..., ``tra_adv-r13.binary`` for the stand-alone
binary format. The files will be called ``.ascii`` for the stand-alone
ASCII library, and ``.nc`` for the NetCDF format.


Note that driver creation is not yet supported in NEMO, see issue #2058.
