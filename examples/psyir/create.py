'''A simple Python script showing how to create a PSyIR tree using the
create methods. In order to use it you must first install
PSyclone. See README.md in the top-level psyclone directory.

Once you have psyclone installed, this script may be run by doing:

>>> python create.py

This should output a Fortran representation of the PSyIR and part of a
C representation of the PSyIR.
